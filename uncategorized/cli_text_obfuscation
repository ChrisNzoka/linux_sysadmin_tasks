# ROT13 text encryption algorithm using tr command line utility

---

tr is a transliteration utitlity. It takes standard input and translates it
according to the specified rule. For instance:

```bash
echo "bash" | tr a-z A-Z
```

Transliteration is the process of changing characters from one alphabet to
another.

**Now, let's encrypt a test file containing the ensuing texts:**

The output begins with the names of the two files and their timestamps. The
first file is marked with asterisks and the second file is marked with dashes.
Throughout the remainder of the listing, these markers will signify their
respective files. Next, we see groups of changes, including the default number
of surrounding context lines.

To encrpyt, we'll use our test file as standard input to tr.

```bash
tr aeiouAEIOU 12345 < testfile.txt > encryptfile
```

**The encryptfile content should contain the following:**

Th2 45tp5t b2g3ns w3th th2 n1m2s 4f th2 tw4 f3l2s 1nd th23r t3m2st1mps. Th2
